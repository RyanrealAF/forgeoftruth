# NOTEBOOKLM DATA EXTRACTION DIRECTIVE
## Curriculum Case Study Mining Protocol

---

## OBJECTIVE

Extract tactical patterns from raw testimony documents and convert into structured case study data for educational curriculum.

---

## SOURCE MATERIAL TYPES

### Query Set 1: Tactical Identification

```
Analyze this document and identify all manipulation tactics demonstrated. 
For each tactic, provide:
- Tactic name/type
- Specific incident showing it
- Who was involved (roles, not names)

```

### Query Set 2: Pattern Recognition

```
What patterns repeat across multiple incidents in this document?
What conditions preceded these incidents?
What tactics commonly appeared together?
What progression/escalation is visible?
```

### Query Set 3: Network Analysis

```
Map the network of actors in this document:
- Who was the primary manipulator?
- Who assisted them (knowingly or unknowingly)?
- Who had access to the target?
- How did information flow between actors?
```

### Query Set 4: Indicator Extraction

```
What early warning signs appear before incidents in this document?
What mid-deployment patterns are visible?
What forensic markers remain after incidents?
How could these have been recognized in real-time?
```

### Query Set 5: Counter-Tactical Analysis

```
What defensive actions were attempted in this document?
Which ones worked and why?
Which ones failed and why?
What should have been done differently?
What documentation was preserved?
```

### Query Set 6: Educational Conversion

```
How would you teach someone to recognize this pattern?
What are the key learning objectives?
What exercises would help readers identify this in their own lives?
What counter-tactics should be taught?
```

### Query Set 7: Case Study Generation

```
Convert the [specific incident] in this document into a de-identified 
case study following this structure:
- Tactical category
- Operational mechanics (step-by-step)
- Tactical objectives
- Case example (anonymized)
- Indicators
- Counter-tactics
- Related tactics
```

## PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA

Extract in this order:

1. **High-frequency tactics** (appeared multiple times)
2. **Clear mechanical examples** (step-by-step visible)
3. **Multi-phase operations** (complex enough to teach from)
4. **Well-documented incidents** (evidence preserved)
5. **Transferable patterns** (applicable beyond your specific case)

---

## QUALITY CHECKS

Each extraction must:

- ✓ Be de-identified (no real names/locations unless tactically necessary)
- ✓ Focus on mechanics, not emotions
- ✓ Provide clear indicators
- ✓ Offer actionable counter-tactics
- ✓ Include training exercises
- ✓ Link to related tactics
- ✓ Specify curriculum placement

## EXAMPLE EXTRACTION

**Source Document:** "Jess Narrative - Apartment Incident"

**NotebookLM Query:**
"Analyze the apartment access incident. What tactic is being demonstrated? Provide step-by-step mechanics, objectives, indicators, and counter-tactics."

**Expected Output:**

TACTIC: The Apartment Visit Probe

CATEGORY: Reconnaissance & Intelligence Gathering

COMPLEXITY: Basic

CURRICULUM PLACEMENT:
- Volume: I
- Module: Reconnaissance & Intelligence Gathering
- Chapter: 1.1 - The Soft Probe
- Prerequisites: None (entry-level tactic)

OPERATIONAL MECHANICS:

Phase 1: Establish Plausible Reason
Operator identifies legitimate-seeming need for physical access to target's private space.

Phase 2: Access Request
Request framed as casual, temporary, specific-purpose visit.

Phase 3: Intelligence Gathering
Once inside, operator observes:
- Security measures (locks, cameras, entry points)
- Financial indicators (possessions, living conditions)
- Personal information (documents visible, schedules posted)
- Vulnerability mapping (routines, habits, resources)

Phase 4: Information Weaponization
Gathered intelligence later used in subsequent tactics.
